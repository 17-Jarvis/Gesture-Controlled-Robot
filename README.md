Hand Gesture Controlled 6DOF Articulated Robot

🚀 Project Overview
An intelligent robotic control system that enables real-time manipulation of a 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) articulated robot using hand gestures. The system uses computer vision to detect and track hand movements, translating them into precise joint commands for robotic manipulation.
🎯 Key Features

Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms for accurate hand tracking
6-DOF Robot Control: Precise manipulation of all six joints (J1-J6) of an articulated robot
Intuitive Finger-Based Joint Mapping: Different finger counts correspond to different joint controls
Distance-Based Movement Control: Hand movements are converted to robot joint angles with calibrated precision
Socket Communication: Real-time TCP/IP communication between vision system and robot controller
Visual Feedback: Live display of finger count, movement distances, and active joint information
